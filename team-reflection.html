                      Once again, I am very satisfied with the overall performance of Team Smiley Face. It was such an honor to work with them throughout the past two assignments. 
                      I’m glad that we were able to get along really well and work together for the duration of this course. Something that could be improved within our group would 
                      be our time management, as towards the end of the semester, we were all flooded with other assignments from our different courses. However, we were able to 
                      complete this assignment despite the other stress our other assignments gave to us. One thing that was surprising while working with this group was that we 
                      chose a name for our application later in the assignment. That moment was very memorable to me as we exchanged ideas and laughter as we brainstormed names 
                      that are clean and wholesome, yet had some hidden messages in it. In the end, we chose a G rated and wholesome name for our app. One thing that I learned about 
                      this group is to be patient and generous with them as I know and understand that we have other assignments to do. Again, I admire working with Dhiraj, Raj, 
                      Nadvi and Aiden. These guys have been such great team members to work with. I will truly miss working with them. I wish them all the best in the future.

                      I am very happy with the performance of Team Smiley Face. The group performed even better than I expected from the last assignment, 
                      which is saying a lot, considering we already had such a good performance last time. The team really pulled through to get our deliverables 
                      out on time, as well as to put forward a solid plan for our project in the future. I am extremely grateful to have worked with such hardworking 
                      and friendly people. I would love to collaborate with them on any future projects.

                      I am happy with my Team smiley face contribution and the performance. Now we have made through almost eight weeks with each other and have reached the end of the semester. 
                      Working with my group was a great experience as each of them was really working hard and doing their part of the assignment. Together we did a good project. We missed some 
                      details in assignment two which cost us some marks but in assignment three we read the specifications well and did the assignment. The most surprising and funny moment of 
                      our assignment was naming our app. During naming our app, we had some many names coming up from everyone which were funny and interesting and then finally we came up with a 
                      name. At this point, I have learned a lot from these group assignments such as how to work as a team and implement an idea practically, secondly time management which is 
                      important when you are working in a group. I am happy and satisfied with my group’s overall performance and now we are just left with the last assignment which is the 
                      presentation part of our project. Cheers to Team smiley face.

                        There are so many wonderful and kind people on the smiley team that I am honored to work with them. The working relationship between my teams has been 
                        outstanding in both assignments 2 and 3. I was glad to be a part of them. One of the very good aspects of the project that we had was the fact that we 
                        communicated frequently, leading to an honest and open discussion about the role each member played. In order to make sure that our strengths were used 
                        in the most effective way, we understood each other's strengths. In light of the good division of tasks and regular communication, we were able to complete 
                        the assignment ahead of schedule as a result of good communication and work division. During this time when everyone is busy with other assignments, I am 
                        grateful that everyone had taken the time to spend a lot of time together to solve some problems that arose in the assignment. I really appreciate everyone's 
                        efforts on that front. All of the team members are very respectful of each other and treat each other with respect.

                        Overall, I think Team Smiley Face did a great job on Assignment 3. While we didn’t get a chance to do any coding of the application itself, 
                        the prototype looks fantastic, and we worked really well as a team to complete each section of the assignment. I've had a good time with this 
                        group assignment which has a lot to be said when it comes to group assignments. I'm glad I had some wonderful group members who were always 
                        willing to contribute and handed their parts in on time and were always willing to help one another.  .

                      Team Smiley face did an excellent job on both assignment two and three. Everyone gave their best in their individual parts with Toni again being the 
                      group leader and assigning the tasks to each one of them and dividing the work equally. Tuan being the website developer of our project was incredibly 
                      good in his work and helping other people in writing the report parts of the assignment. He also made us a great website for our assignment. Raj being 
                      at his best did his parts of the assignment well. Also, he was the first one to bring our company and app’s name. Nadvi was the head of our prototype 
                      which were going to implement and made an innovative output for that which our project needed. Dhiraj helped in writing parts of the assignment and 
                      helped other people in their respective parts of the assignment. He was also good at his work. Together we all came up to a great project idea and 
                      implemented it practically.  A team effort made the assignment much better and now we all are looking forward to the final part of our project which 
                      is the presentation and hopefully we will do it as good as we did these assignments.
