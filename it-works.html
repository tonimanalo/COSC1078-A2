                    <p class="content">Our team members Raj, Aiden and Nadvi interviewed Raymond, a software engineer at PageUp, to try and gain some insight into the aspects 
                        of being an IT professional Raj was in charge of getting to know the ins and outs of what its like being a software engineer, while Nadvi was in charge 
                        of the technical questions. Aiden was present in order to oversee the interview. Below is a summary of the questions asked and answers given in said 
                        interview<br><br><b>Q: Why did you decide to become a software engineer</b><br>A: It appears that our Raymond tried several other majors before finally 
                        finding his passion with software engineering. Software engineering also seems to align with Raymond’s personality, with him enjoying being indoors and 
                        working on project that are aimed at helping make people’s lives a little easier<br><br><b>Q: What frameworks and languages do you mainly use?</b><br> A: 
                        The main frameworks currently in use by Raymond and his team are .Net for backend and React for their frontend, with AWS being their preferred cloud provider. 
                        These frameworks are mostly used to work on Web Applications<br><br><b>Q: What do you think is important when you are checking a team member’s code?</b><br>A: 
                        The 2 main aspects to look for are readability of the code and if the code’s functionality aligns with the requirements of the client specified in the task. 
                        Raymond believes that the later would be the more important aspect of the two. A helpful tip to make code more readable given to us by Raymond would be to 
                        lower the number of if conditions in use. It doesn’t matter if your code looks cool if is a hard to read mess!<br><br><b>Q: What tools do you use to work 
                        with your agile methodology?</b><br>A: Raymond’s team uses Jira for all aspects of their project management, including handling sprints, user stories 
                        and the backlog<br><br><b>Q: Could you give us a step-by-step process of what you would do as a software engineer?</b><br>A: Raymond would flex between 
                        working on the backend and frontend depending on where his team needs him. Raymond and his team have a stand-up each day, where they would discuss the 
                        tasks and user stories they are working on. They would then get to coding on whatever task/story they set out to work on.<br><br><b>Q: What kind of people 
                        do you work with?</b><br>A: Raymond works with a variety of different personalities and stressed on the importance of being able to adapt to all of them 
                        and their working styles.<br><br><b>Q: Do you meet a lot of new people in your line of work?</b><br>A: Raymond mostly works with a small team, but after 
                        being promoted to being an Epic leader, Raymond is required to work with people from the business to understand their requirements<br><br><b>Q: Does being 
                        an Epic leader mean you handle pull requests?</b><br>A: Yes, Raymond does review pull requests put in by his team <br><br><b>Q: Do you interact with your 
                        clients a lot?</b><br>A: Raymond does not work directly with clients a lot of the time, as it is mostly the role of the UX or User Experience team<br><br>
                        <b>Q: What aspect of your work do you spend the most time on?</b><br>A: Testing would be the task that takes Raymond the longest. Writing something new is 
                        easy, but ensuring it satisfies requirements and doesn’t affect the rest of the features is where the real challenge lies.<br><br><b>Q: Would you have any 
                        advice for us as aspiring IT professionals?</b><br>A: Raymond gave us several tips: <ul><li>Get exposed to as many languages </li><li>Make as many friends 
                        as possible, it is less about what you know and more about who you know </li><li>Finding jobs through references is a lot easier </li><li>Solve problems 
                        through a business perspective </li></ul><br><br>The interview was overall a very insightful and productive learning experience for the entire team<br><br>
                        The interview was overall a very insightful and productive learning experience for the entire team. We learnt a lot about the general software engineering 
                        process and what it is like working for and even leading a small team of diverse developers.<br><br>We also gained a lot of insight to what parts of the software 
                        engineering process that take the longest and what we would need to focus on to get our deliverables out on time.<br><br>An aspect to working IT that came as a bit 
                        of a surprise was how important adaptability was. Whether it is switching from a front end to a back end dev or switching up your task flow in order to meet your 
                        clients demands, adaptability seems to be of utmost importance.<br><br>If nothing else, Raymond made us very excited to enter the world of IT professionals and get our careers started!   </p>
