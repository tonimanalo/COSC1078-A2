                                <p class="p-IIT">A project idea I would like to innovate is a mobile application consisting of a shared calendar amongst a group of users. T
                                    he features included in this calendar are inputs of their events, linking other calendars to the shared calendar and personalize it to 
                                    their liking. All users input their weekly schedules, then the app will combine everyone’s schedule to find the times when everyone is 
                                    available. This can be used for anything from social sport gatherings to night outs or even just a trip to the movies. This helps the 
                                    whole organization period a little easier. In addition to the shared calendar, the application will also feature a section that gathers 
                                    information of restaurants in the city or the area the user is located in. Another function of the application gives the user the ability 
                                    to input their chosen songs from Spotify into a shared playlist amongst the group of users. So, whether you’re playing a sport, travelling 
                                    to a destination, or hitting the dance floor, the music will be on point with everyone’s desired music taste implemented into the playlist rotation.  </p>

                                <p class="p-IIT"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I usually went to play soccer with my friends when I was in high school. Our passion for soccer makes us frequent have a soccer matches together.
                                    The difficulty we faced at that time was finding a free common time to play matches with all members. Sometimes we have matches that don't have enough members, 
                                    which causes the match to be incomplete. It's very difficult for us to have a full match with all the members. With this software, we hope to overcome the above 
                                    difficulties. Our busy lives made it impossible for us to regularly catch up and meet while we were juggling university and jobs. So there were a lot of obstacles 
                                    to us having a same free time to soccer games together and even being able to meet up. In addition, I've found it very difficult to get everyone to pay attention 
                                    during the meetups when they need to respond on a pending hangout without someone posting a meme, sending a TikTok or continuing a joke that was made earlier in the meeting. 
                                    According to bankmycell, it is up to 91% of people own mobile phones today in the worldwide. Especially the younger generation is very familiar with the use of smartphones in 
                                    order to listen to music. We could see that would be great if there is a software gives the user the ability to input their chosen songs from Spotify into a shared playlist amongst 
                                    the group of users. The playlist rotation will ensure that everyone's preferred music tastes are incorporated into the playlist, no matter what you are doing, whether you are playing 
                                    a sport, travelling, or hitting the dance floor. We created this software as the solution to the above problems. </h6>

                                <h6 id="description">Description</h6>
                                <p class="p-IIT">The application is similar to your average calendar application on your smartphone like adding events, tasks or reminders, importing 
                                    and exporting calendars and staying organised. However, the project idea we have come up with have added features that makes it very unique. 
                                    One of the features that this mobile application has is that the user is able to share their calendar with friends or family and vice versa. 
                                    This feature allows the user and the group they shared the calendar with to easily find an available time and day to gather and catch up. It 
                                    makes it much easier and more efficient to block out the time and days they are not available rather than typing it in a group chat or saying 
                                    it in person and eventually forgetting about it. <br>Another feature this product has is the ability for the user and their group to personalise 
                                    the calendar however they like. Different types of groups of people have different aesthetics. We want to ensure this feature is in the mobile 
                                    application as the user is free to customise their calendar to their liking with different themes and colours to create a sense of personalisation.
                                    <br>The Spotify connection feature will allow each person to link their Spotify account within the app. This allows each person to pick 15 songs 
                                    each which will then be added to a communal playlist. These 15 songs can be changed at the start of each week to keep everyone happy as new music 
                                    is released, and new tunes are discovered. Having this set number of songs gives everyone an equal chance to have their tracks played. This removes 
                                    the chance of someone spamming songs into the playlist and ruining the variety of songs. This feature also removes the inconvenience of picking songs 
                                    with multiple music tastes in a group. A ‘self-skip’ feature will also be included that only allows the owner of the song or the person who chose the 
                                    song for the playlist to skip the song.<br>You will also be able to create different groups within the app. For example, you might have your basketball 
                                    team group, your main social group or even a family group. This will allow you to tailor what music you want for each group. In the basketball group you 
                                    would want more upbeat and enthusiastic music. For the social group, you could add chill or workout music. For family, you can add songs that focuses on 
                                    the classics that parents or elderly people will like and keeping it family friendly.<br>An additional feature this mobile application has is a service 
                                    that lists restaurants nearby the users location, trending places to eat, restaurants with specific cuisines and search restaurants. In addition to the services 
                                    listed above, the user can look at the menu of the restaurant, read the reviews, make a booking and view the opening hours of the restaurant. This feature makes 
                                    it easier for the user to plan ahead of time and find a place to eat. </p>

                                        <li>In order to successfully develop and launch this software, various knowledge and skills across different areas are needed. In the first place. 
                                            Our team needs to work collaboratively on the application and in order to do so we need to use a GitHub repository. There are also features on 
                                            GitHub like branching, which allows you to keep the main release of the application running while adding updates to future versions using GitHub's 
                                            branching feature. We would also be possible to use a project management tool such as Jira to keep track of all the features that need to be added 
                                            to the app as well as assign these features to different members of the team who are working on them. </li>
                                        <li>As we will be needing a variety of skills in order to execute the creation of this app, we should be acquainted with Xcode, which is the user 
                                            interface you will need in order to build an iOS app. There are other programming languages we would be use besides Swift and Objective-C such 
                                            as JavaScript, Xamarin, and Objective-C. In order to carry out this development, we should have a Mac computer that has been updated to the 
                                            latest version in order to optimize the performance of this development</li>
                                        <li>In order to make sure that the app works properly while it is being developed, it is imperative that we test as we code the app. It will ensure that we do not miss any major 
                                            bugs that may arise when the app is released, as we will be able to track them down</li>
                                        <li>As we continue to add new features to the code, we will use a continuous integration system such as CircleCI to make sure any bugs that might appear are caught automatically by a continuous integration system</li>
                                        <li>After we have built a project that is feasible for release, we must then think of what to do when it comes to deploying that project. If we want to containerize our app, we can use some kind of platform like Docker, 
                                            in order to do this, which will allow us to host the app in an environment that is similar to the one that it was developed in, which in turn will limit the number of unforseen bugs that occur over time </li>
                                        <li>In the final stage of the deployment phase, we will be considering what cloud platform we will use to deploy our applications in the cloud. We found AWS to be an easy to use hosting platform that can be easily set up 
                                            for our needs. In order to facilitate the delivery of our content, we could use their Elastic Beanstalk service in combination with Amazon Web Services CloudFront </li>
                                        <li>After completing the development of the version to be released, it is now time for us to test the application. To set up large-scale testing with multiple devices, we could use AWS Device Farm as a way to make it easier</li>
                                        <li>To ensure that as many bugs are caught as early in the life cycle of a product as possible, it is essential that we do this. In the coming phases of alpha and beta, we will continue to test our applications in real-world 
                                            conditions in order to ensure their quality. We will be able to set ourselves up for our first public release if everything goes according to plan</li>
                                        <li> In order to make our app visible to as many people as possible once it is in the AppStore, we will have to think about SEO techniques, so that it will appear to as many people as possible. 
                                            There is even a possibility that we might consider paid social media marketing in order to increase our reach even further.</li>

                                    to meet up or catch up with each other. Users would also have an application that would add each user’s current song rotation into a shared playlist with friends. 
                                    We also hope that it would also find it easier for the user and their friends to find a restaurant where they can catch up and enjoy good food. The impact of this 
                                    app would be efficient to those who have a busy schedule yet want to make time to meet those who are dear to them while eating at good places and to listen to each 
                                    other’s music taste.
