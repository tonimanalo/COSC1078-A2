                                <p class="p-IIT">A project idea I would like to innovate is a mobile application consisting of a shared calendar amongst a group of users. T
                                    he features included in this calendar are inputs of their events, linking other calendars to the shared calendar and personalize it to 
                                    their liking. All users input their weekly schedules, then the app will combine everyone’s schedule to find the times when everyone is 
                                    available. This can be used for anything from social sport gatherings to night outs or even just a trip to the movies. This helps the 
                                    whole organization period a little easier. In addition to the shared calendar, the application will also feature a section that gathers 
                                    information of restaurants in the city or the area the user is located in. Another function of the application gives the user the ability 
                                    to input their chosen songs from Spotify into a shared playlist amongst the group of users. So, whether you’re playing a sport, travelling 
                                    to a destination, or hitting the dance floor, the music will be on point with everyone’s desired music taste implemented into the playlist rotation.  </p>
                                <!-- Blockchain/Cryptocurrency      -->
                                <h6 id="motivation">Motivation</h6>
                                <p class="p-IIT">The motivation behind this project idea is to assist groups of friends to organise social events or gatherings more efficiently. 
                                    Entering adulthood made it hard for us to regularly meet and catch up while juggling with university and work whereas compared to high school, 
                                    it was easier for us to see each other. Also, when organizing meetups, it’s very difficult to get everyone to pay attention when they need to 
                                    give a response on a pending hang out without someone posting a meme, sending a TikTok or continuing a joke that was said previously. Another 
                                    motivation for this application was for a group of users to have a shared playlist of songs. This allows users to discover even more songs from 
                                    their friends and can also be a very good conversation starter. Therefore, this project idea was to create a mobile application that enables us 
                                    to share each other’s schedules to help us determine when a group of users are all free to meet up and to also browse top or trending restaurants 
                                    on the side to decide where we can eat and catch-up, while having a shared song playlist with other users. </h6>

                                <h6 id="description">Description</h6>
                                <p class="p-IIT">The application is similar to your average calendar application on your smartphone like adding events, tasks or reminders, importing 
                                    and exporting calendars and staying organised. However, the project idea we have come up with have added features that makes it very unique. 
                                    One of the features that this mobile application has is that the user is able to share their calendar with friends or family and vice versa. 
                                    This feature allows the user and the group they shared the calendar with to easily find an available time and day to gather and catch up. It 
                                    makes it much easier and more efficient to block out the time and days they are not available rather than typing it in a group chat or saying 
                                    it in person and eventually forgetting about it.<br>Another feature this product has is the ability for the user and their group to personalise 
                                    the calendar however they like. Different types of groups of people have different aesthetics. We want to ensure this feature is in the mobile 
                                    application as the user is free to customise their calendar to their liking with different themes and colours to create a sense of personalisation.
                                    <br>The Spotify connection feature will allow each person to link their Spotify account within the app. This allows each person to pick 15 songs 
                                    each which will then be added to a communal playlist. These 15 songs can be changed at the start of each week to keep everyone happy as new music 
                                    is released, and new tunes are discovered. Having this set number of songs gives everyone an equal chance to have their tracks played. This removes 
                                    the chance of someone spamming songs into the playlist and ruining the variety of songs. This feature also removes the inconvenience of picking songs 
                                    with multiple music tastes in a group. A ‘self-skip’ feature will also be included that only allows the owner of the song or the person who chose the 
                                    song for the playlist to skip the song.<br>You will also be able to create different groups within the app. For example, you might have your basketball 
                                    team group, your main social group or even a family group. This will allow you to tailor what music you want for each group. In the basketball group you 
                                    would want more upbeat and enthusiastic music. For the social group, you could add chill or workout music. For family, you can add songs that focuses on 
                                    the classics that parents or elderly people will like and keeping it family friendly.<br>An additional feature this mobile application has is a service 
                                    that lists restaurants nearby the users location, trending places to eat, restaurants with specific cuisines and search restaurants. In addition to the services 
                                    listed above, the user can look at the menu of the restaurant, read the reviews, make a booking and view the opening hours of the restaurant. This feature makes 
                                    it easier for the user to plan ahead of time and find a place to eat. </p>

                                
                                <h6 id="tools">Tools, Technologies and Skills Required: </h6>
                                <p class="p-IIT">To execute the creation of this app various skills be useful mainly, competence with XCode which is ¬the UI you will need to create an iOS app. 
                                    You can program using other languages such as Swift, Objective-C, JavaScript or Xamarin. To conduct this development, you will need a Mac computer that is 
                                    updated to the latest version to optimise performance. Once you develop your app to must put it through Beta testing with a selected group of users to collect 
                                    vital feedback. If you can’t get physical devices to test on, then you can test with devices that are accessible on the cloud. Within the app we will need to 
                                    write a program that allows for the input of a schedule and then the comparison of multiple schedules to pinpoint a time in the week where nothing is scheduled 
                                    across all group members. We then write a program to allow each user to create a 15-song playlist within Spotify to then combine with other group members into 
                                    one large playlist. We will then need a lot of money to offer restaurants to be in our service. Then you can deploy your app onto the App store. This is all 
                                    accompanied by excessive amounts of marketing if we want the app to take off.  
                                </p>
                               
                                <h6 id="outcome">Outcome</h6>
                                <p class="p-IIT">If the project is successful, we hope that it would help users and their group of friends to easily find a date and time where they are all available 
                                    to meet up or catch up with each other. Users would also have an application that would add each user’s current song rotation into a shared playlist with friends. 
                                    We also hope that it would also find it easier for the user and their friends to find a restaurant where they can catch up and enjoy good food. The impact of this 
                                    app would be efficient to those who have a busy schedule yet want to make time to meet those who are dear to them while eating at good places and to listen to each 
                                    other’s music taste.
