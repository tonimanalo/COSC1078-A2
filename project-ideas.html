                                    Pal which has a shared calendar amongst a group of users. Nowadays people are busier with their work and rarely they socialize outside with their friends, 
                                    cousins, colleagues and are it becomes difficult for everyone to plan immediately as everyone has some prior commitments. So, our app will help people to 
                                    plan events, meetings with their friends, family. The big picture here is that people nowadays only prefer work over spending some quality time with other 
                                    fellow people. This app will make them socialize more and have a good balance between work and quality time. So, everyone sharing their schedules will help 
                                    them plan hangouts as the special thing of our app gives the names of the nearby trending restaurants and bars which is the great way to find a perfect place
                                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, Plan Pal helps share their Spotify playlist and now people can have the hang of different 
                                    music genres and music tells a lot about someoneâ€™s choice. This way people can initiate conversations with more and more people which is a lot more helpful 
                                    if you are new to a university and if you are an international student, the app will help you to engage with more people in your course or with people in the 
                                    university. All of this makes Plan Pal a great choice for increasing your engagement with your friends and family.

                                <p class="p-IIT"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I usually went to play soccer with my friends when I was in high school. Our passion for soccer makes us frequent have a soccer matches together.
                                    The difficulty we faced at that time was finding a free common time to play matches with all members. Sometimes we have matches that don't have enough members, 
                                    which causes the match to be incomplete. It's very difficult for us to have a full match with all the members. With this software, we hope to overcome the above 
                                    difficulties. Our busy lives made it impossible for us to regularly catch up and meet while we were juggling university and jobs. So there were a lot of obstacles 
                                    to us having a same free time to soccer games together and even being able to meet up. In addition, I've found it very difficult to get everyone to pay attention 
                                    during the meetups when they need to respond on a pending hangout without someone posting a meme, sending a TikTok or continuing a joke that was made earlier in the meeting. 
                                    According to bankmycell, it is up to 91% of people own mobile phones today in the worldwide. Especially the younger generation is very familiar with the use of smartphones in 
                                    order to listen to music. We could see that would be great if there is a software gives the user the ability to input their chosen songs from Spotify into a shared playlist amongst 
                                    the group of users. The playlist rotation will ensure that everyone's preferred music tastes are incorporated into the playlist, no matter what you are doing, whether you are playing 
                                    a sport, travelling, or hitting the dance floor. We created this software as the solution to the above problems. </h6>

                                    <li>The aim for our project would be helping people to have a good balance in their work and enjoyment and help people engage with people whom they just met or donâ€™t know 
                                        that person that much. Initiating conversations will help them create new friends and socialize more. This way people will not just work but also plan events 
                                        with their fellow friends and enjoy a good time</li>
                                    <li>Reduce stress among people is one of our major goals. There is a horse race going on among people in terms of work. 
                                        People are stressing too much on work. They need to relax and just chill for at least some time. Otherwise, people will feel burdened, and this stress can lead to 
                                        some bad consequences. Plan pal helps them in managing their time outside of their work by having a shared calendar.</li>
                                    <li>The second goal of our project will be 
                                        creating new friends. Everyone wants to have create new friends and our app will help this in a new and innovative way by sharing their Spotify playlist and then 
                                        having conversations with new people and after that they can hang out with each other at a restaurant and our app will also help them in choosing the restaurant. 
                                        This way people will know about everyoneâ€™s interest and know other people better. You can create groups with your friends and now chat with each other. 
                                        Communicating is the best way to express and our app makes you do it.</li>
                                    <li>The third goal would be having more people use this app. We want our app to 
                                        reach everyone i.e., university students, teachers, professors, employees etc. The target audience of our app mostly would be university students. 
                                        For that we can create awareness through posters, campaigns inside a university/by running online advertisements or making people aware by having a 
                                        face-to-face conversation explaining them about managing workload and also enjoy your life and about how you can use our app for doing this.</li>

                                <p class="p-IIT"><strong><em>Maritoni Manalo â€“ Project lead and group leader</em></strong></p>
                                <p class="p-IIT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toniâ€™s role is organisation and management of the project and group as a whole. Due to the project being Toni and Zaneâ€™s idea originally, her vision is one the group follows. 
                                    Toni is also responsible for the groupâ€™s roles and responsibilities. She was the one to designate roles within the group, organise when the group meets, 
                                    what the group talks about and what each member of the group does in their role. Toni also provides the foundations for the vision set by the group in what 
                                    is being done right now and what we are aiming towards.  </p>

                                <p class="p-IIT"><strong><em>Tuan Kiet Tran â€“ Back-end engineer</em></strong></p>
                                <p class="p-IIT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aidenâ€™s role is simple. He gets told what is wanted for the 
                                    project by the group and using his coding magic he makes it actually work. Not only that but Aiden will be implementing the website 
                                    we are using to describe our entire assignment 3. Aiden is good and enjoys problem solving and regardless of the complex design choices 
                                    made by other members of the group, he will deliver by creating the structure of the application itself.  </p>
                                
                                <p class="p-IIT"><strong><em>Dunith Nadvi Karawita - Visual design and front-end engineer</em></strong></p>
                                <p class="p-IIT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nadviâ€™s role is to build a prototype of what the final project will 
                                    look like. He is responsible for how the design on the application looks with comments from other group members influencing his prototype decisions. 
                                    He will also be working with Aiden on engineering the final proof of the project, with Aiden working on back end and Nadvi working on front end. 
                                    He will code for what the application looks like for the end user and how the interface will flow. </p>

                                <p class="p-IIT"><strong><em>Dhiraj Swain â€“ Team helper and reliableÂ </em></strong></p>
                                <p class="p-IIT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dhiraj will be the jack that helps all the trades. 
                                    He will be mainly focusing on filling in gaps of the assignment that others didnâ€™t want to do. However, whenever someone 
                                    in the group needs his help Dhiraj is happy to oblige. Dhiraj is reliable and helpful, thatâ€™s why he was given the role of 
                                    helper extraordinaire whenever another cog in the wheel is coming undone. </p>

                                <p class="p-IIT"><strong><em>Raj Parhaar â€“ Creative guide and scribe</em></strong></p>
                                <p class="p-IIT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raj will be focusing on the other parts of the assignment that have little to do 
                                    with the project itself. Raj will build the team profile; he will note down the plans for the project and progress of the work being performed. He is working 
                                    on the skills and jobs section, the group reflection section and of course the roles section. Raj isnâ€™t the reason the project idea will be completed but he 
                                    is the reason assignment 3 will be handed in. </p>

                                <h6 id="scope">Scope and limit</h6>
                                <p class="p-IIT">////</p>
                                
                                <h6 id="description">Description</h6>
                                <p class="p-IIT">The application is similar to your average calendar application on your smartphone like adding events, tasks or reminders, importing 
                                    and exporting calendars and staying organised. However, the project idea we have come up with have added features that makes it very unique. 
                                    One of the features that this mobile application has is that the user is able to share their calendar with friends or family and vice versa. 
                                    This feature allows the user and the group they shared the calendar with to easily find an available time and day to gather and catch up. It 
                                    makes it much easier and more efficient to block out the time and days they are not available rather than typing it in a group chat or saying 
                                    it in person and eventually forgetting about it. <br>Another feature this product has is the ability for the user and their group to personalise 
                                    the calendar however they like. Different types of groups of people have different aesthetics. We want to ensure this feature is in the mobile 
                                    application as the user is free to customise their calendar to their liking with different themes and colours to create a sense of personalisation.
                                    <br>The Spotify connection feature will allow each person to link their Spotify account within the app. This allows each person to pick 15 songs 
                                    each which will then be added to a communal playlist. These 15 songs can be changed at the start of each week to keep everyone happy as new music 
                                    is released, and new tunes are discovered. Having this set number of songs gives everyone an equal chance to have their tracks played. This removes 
                                    the chance of someone spamming songs into the playlist and ruining the variety of songs. This feature also removes the inconvenience of picking songs 
                                    with multiple music tastes in a group. A â€˜self-skipâ€™ feature will also be included that only allows the owner of the song or the person who chose the 
                                    song for the playlist to skip the song.<br>You will also be able to create different groups within the app. For example, you might have your basketball 
                                    team group, your main social group or even a family group. This will allow you to tailor what music you want for each group. In the basketball group you 
                                    would want more upbeat and enthusiastic music. For the social group, you could add chill or workout music. For family, you can add songs that focuses on 
                                    the classics that parents or elderly people will like and keeping it family friendly.<br>An additional feature this mobile application has is a service 
                                    that lists restaurants nearby the users location, trending places to eat, restaurants with specific cuisines and search restaurants. In addition to the services 
                                    listed above, the user can look at the menu of the restaurant, read the reviews, make a booking and view the opening hours of the restaurant. This feature makes 
                                    it easier for the user to plan ahead of time and find a place to eat. </p>

                                <p class="p-IIT">
                                    <ul class="p-IIT">
                                        <li>In order to successfully develop and launch this software, various knowledge and skills across different areas are needed. In the first place. 
                                            Our team needs to work collaboratively on the application and in order to do so we need to use a GitHub repository. There are also features on 
                                            GitHub like branching, which allows you to keep the main release of the application running while adding updates to future versions using GitHub's 
                                            branching feature. We would also be possible to use a project management tool such as Jira to keep track of all the features that need to be added 
                                            to the app as well as assign these features to different members of the team who are working on them. </li>
                                        <li>As we will be needing a variety of skills in order to execute the creation of this app, we should be acquainted with Xcode, which is the user 
                                            interface you will need in order to build an iOS app. There are other programming languages we would be use besides Swift and Objective-C such 
                                            as JavaScript, Xamarin, and Objective-C. In order to carry out this development, we should have a Mac computer that has been updated to the 
                                            latest version in order to optimize the performance of this development</li>
                                        <li>In order to make sure that the app works properly while it is being developed, it is imperative that we test as we code the app. It will ensure that we do not miss any major 
                                            bugs that may arise when the app is released, as we will be able to track them down</li>
                                        <li>As we continue to add new features to the code, we will use a continuous integration system such as CircleCI to make sure any bugs that might appear are caught automatically by a continuous integration system</li>
                                        <li>After we have built a project that is feasible for release, we must then think of what to do when it comes to deploying that project. If we want to containerize our app, we can use some kind of platform like Docker, 
                                            in order to do this, which will allow us to host the app in an environment that is similar to the one that it was developed in, which in turn will limit the number of unforseen bugs that occur over time </li>
                                        <li>In the final stage of the deployment phase, we will be considering what cloud platform we will use to deploy our applications in the cloud. We found AWS to be an easy to use hosting platform that can be easily set up 
                                            for our needs. In order to facilitate the delivery of our content, we could use their Elastic Beanstalk service in combination with Amazon Web Services CloudFront </li>
                                        <li>After completing the development of the version to be released, it is now time for us to test the application. To set up large-scale testing with multiple devices, we could use AWS Device Farm as a way to make it easier</li>
                                        <li>To ensure that as many bugs are caught as early in the life cycle of a product as possible, it is essential that we do this. In the coming phases of alpha and beta, we will continue to test our applications in real-world 
                                            conditions in order to ensure their quality. We will be able to set ourselves up for our first public release if everything goes according to plan</li>
                                        <li> In order to make our app visible to as many people as possible once it is in the AppStore, we will have to think about SEO techniques, so that it will appear to as many people as possible. 
                                            There is even a possibility that we might consider paid social media marketing in order to increase our reach even further.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>

                                <p class="p-IIT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our group has decided to use Microsoft Teams to communicate throughout this assignment. Teams have been helpful to us as 
                                    we are able to upload our work and edit our work simultaneously with other team members. We aim to have our group meetings twice a week. 
                                    We would meet face-to-face during our Wednesday class from 3:30pm-5:30pm and meet online via Teams on Sundays at 9pm. Group members have 
                                    been actively communicating on Teams in the group chat reminding each other about meetings or their tasks in the assignment and have been 
                                    private messaging other members in the group if they have any questions or wanted to clarify some concerns they had. In the event a member 
                                    does not reply to a message sent to the group chat for a while, we would message the group member via Instagram or text message. One common 
                                    issue that we all faced as a group when using Teams is that we did not get notifications whenever someone messaged the team chat which caused 
                                    a delay in some aspects of the assignment.  </p>
                               
                                <h6 id="outcome">Outcome</h6>
                                <p class="p-IIT">If the project is successful, we hope that it would help users and their group of friends to easily find a date and time where they are all available 
                                    to meet up or catch up with each other. Users would also have an application that would add each userâ€™s current song rotation into a shared playlist with friends. 
                                    We also hope that it would also find it easier for the user and their friends to find a restaurant where they can catch up and enjoy good food. The impact of this 
                                    app would be efficient to those who have a busy schedule yet want to make time to meet those who are dear to them while eating at good places and to listen to each 
                                    otherâ€™s music taste.
