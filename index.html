                <p class="content">Overall team Smiley Face worked very well together for assignment 2. Each member was a 
                    team player and contributed what was asked of them and volunteered for more to produce assignment 2. Toni was instrumental 
                    in focusing the team on driving results and planning outcomes. She delivered her report with our lost team member Zane as 
                    well. Aiden conjured a beautiful website that had all our team’s contributions. Him and Nadvi delivered their report. Nadvi 
                    helped with the interview, gave advice about technical information for the website and GitHub and as mentioned delivered his 
                    report with Aiden. Dhiraj helped everyone when they needed it with their part of the assignment and solo delivered his 
                    report. Raj wrote about the group, helped with writing interview questions, wrote the group reflection and delivered his report.<br><br>
                    Something important we learned about our team were our roles shifted as we found our skills and what we were most comfortable with. 
                    While Toni was good at leading, she was excellent at organising team agendas, deadlines and collating the report. Raj turned out 
                    to be a creative connoisseur, happy to take any creative aspect of the report such as the team profile and group reflection, 
                    focusing less on the IT aspects of the assignment. Dhiraj although good at pumping out ideas was a champion at helping fill holes 
                    that other team members needed filled. He was always happy to help with other team members work when his own was finished. Aiden and 
                    Nadvi were mostly true to their initial roles with Aiden excelling at the technical side of site creation and Nadvi a brilliant mentor 
                    for all things related to the assignment whenever someone needed advice.<br><br>
                    Things to work on for assignment 3 include everyone’s contribution to the project idea itself. Since Toni and Zane had the initial 
                    project idea it was decided at the start, they would focus mainly on the project idea part of assignment 2. This however turned out 
                    to be a bad decision as the scope of the project idea part of the assignment was too large and especially when Zane left the group, 
                    too much responsibility was put onto Toni’s shoulders. While Nadvi and Dhiraj swooped in to save the day, helping Toni out with the 
                    missing parts of the project idea, going forward all team members will be allocated to work on the project itself rather than leaving 
                    it to only a few people on the team.

                    <li>Nadvi – Principal Machine Learning Engineer </li>
                </ul>

                <p class="content">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Dhiraj and Aiden’s ideal jobs involve developing new software to meet client needs. Unlike Raj who wants a job that 
                    involve leadership and planning for overall projects, Dhiraj and Aiden’s jobs are more focused on developing the actual software used on 
                    the ground through coding and development through a wide array of software types. Dhiraj is more interesting the coding and leg work it 
                    takes to find creative software solutions where Aiden is more interesting in analysing his team member’s work and code to see if it fits 
                    the client’s needs. Both Dhiraj and Aiden ideal jobs require a wealth of knowledge in different coding languages and IT software’s to allow 
                    creative solutions to any issue’s their clients might have and need to be jacks of all trades in this regard.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Toni and Nadvi’s ideal 
                    jobs involve designing and implementing software solutions through already defined and constrained relationships in their respective fields. 
                    Toni is specifically interested in Cyber Security relations and Nadvi is interested in machine learning algorithms. Toni’s ideal job includes 
                    understanding cryptography, networking and security models, specific skills that require a depth of knowledge in understanding Cyber Security 
                    to be able to deliver design solutions to an important and substation field of IT. Nadvi’s ideal job involves understanding machine learning 
                    models which is enough said with its complexity. His skills in this field not only provide solutions to individual client tasks but could provide 
                    solutions to already well-established IT technologies that are much more efficient and profitable using machine learning. Both Toni and Nadvi need 
                    the programming and understanding skills for their respective fields yes, but also need a passion for creative thinking in fields that are high in 
                    demand in the IT world.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raj’s ideal jobs involve being part of the bigger picture. Unlike the other members of the team that work directly with 
                    the software they are developing or implementing, Raj’s ideal jobs consist of thinking about implementation on a broader scale for clients or companies. 
                    Raj’s more broad job would include the direction for the company to deliver the entire package of solutions to clients. Raj has lofty ideals as these 
                    roles would not just encompass knowing the ins and outs of a wide array of technologies, coding languages, communication technologies and engineering 
                    skills but would also require out of IT skills such as leadership, organization and knowing the direction of their respective companies/clients in order 
                    to lead others towards the same goal.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarities between each job include placing each person in a position of responsibility and authority over 
                    their craft. Aiden and Dhiraj want to be reliable software engineers that are experts in their work, while Toni and Nadvi want to be experts in their 
                    field of learning, while Raj being a bit of an exception still wants others to look up to him as an expert in the field of IT. </p>

Born in Brisbane coming from Jordanian background, Zane does not let his working man style get in the way of enjoying hobbies, including listening to hip hop music, playing lots of basketball and obsession with the shoe industry. His Myers-Briggs personality is ISFJ-T, meaning he sees himself as the detail-oriented worker, able to lead or play his part as the situation suites. His sense of responsibility to the people around him in the group means no matter what the group needs Zane to have done, Zane does it with an eye for detail and on time. There are few people as reliable as Zane.</p>
